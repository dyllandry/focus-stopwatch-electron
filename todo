  Maybe I should move over to redux because if it lets me write my stopwatch logic outside of any react component, then I could write tests for it outside of any rendering. Then have other dedicate tests for rendering stuff.
  redux store
    ✔ add store, slice, reducer boiler @done(22-08-27 22:57)
    ☐ test that store starts with session types empty
    startSession tests:
      ☐ test that it adds a new session type list if one didn't exist
      ☐ test that it adds a new session if one didn't exist
        make sure length of sessions only increased by 1
      ☐ test that it adds a new session to the right session type
        test adding works to session type that is already current
        test adding works to different session type than is already current
      ☐ test that the newly added session type doesn't have an end time
  ☐ add start session button
    ☐ start session logic
    ☐ start session button
    ☐ test

  Heres an implementation plan
    1) Functions have to be written in TypeScript
    2) Functions will be inside react components
    3) Tests will be written using Jest

    <FocusStopwatch />
      state
        sessionsByType
        currentSessionType
        paused

    <SessionTotals />
      This is the two boxes at the top of the window showing the total time spent in both session types.
      props
        sessionsByType
        currentSessionType - For session labels.
        paused - For session labels.

    <SessionTypeTotal />
      props
        sessions
        currentSessionType


    <SessionTypeName />
      This will show the name of the session type and its state like "Focus (Active)"
      state
      props
        currentSessionType
        paused

    <Duration />
      This will just format nicely a time that it is given as 00:00:00
      props
        durationInMs

    <FocusStopwatchControls />
      This will have some inputs like
        Start Focus
        Start Rest
        Pause
      props
        handleStartFocusPress - These will be functions passed down by parent component <FocusStopwatch /> that will modify the stopwatch's state.
        handleStartRestPress
        handlePausePress

    <StartSessionTypeButton />
      The parent component <FocusStopwatchControls /> will not show the <StartSessionTypeButton /> if that session type is already active.
      props
        sessionType
        handleStartSessionTypePress - This will be one of handleStartRestPress or handleStartFocusPress passed from <FocusStopwatchControls />

    <PauseButton />
      props
        handlePausePress

todo later:
  swap out useState for redux-toolkit
